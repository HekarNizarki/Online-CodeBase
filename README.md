# Python Code Snippets Repositor

This repository contains a collection of Python code snippets, each solving a specific algorithmic or data structure problem. The code snippets are organized as individual Python files, each named after the problem it addresses (e.g., `3Sum.py`, `Add_Digits.py`).

## Structure
- **Python Code Snippets/**: This folder contains all the Python files, each representing a different coding problem and its solution.
- **Ground Truth of Python Code Snippets with (PEP 8 and Coding Best Practice Violations).docx**: A document providing ground truth and analysis of the code snippets, including notes on PEP 8 and coding best practice violations.

## Purpose
The repository is intended for:
- Studying and analyzing Python code quality, PEP 8 compliance, and best practices.
- Serving as a resource for learning and reference for common coding interview problems.
- Benchmarking and research in code analysis, style checking, and automated code review tools.

## Usage
You can browse the `Python Code Snippets` directory to find solutions to various problems. Each file is self-contained and can be run independently.
